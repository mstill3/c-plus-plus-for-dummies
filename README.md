Building CPP file:
```
g++ FILE_NAME.cpp -o OUTPUT_NAME
```

Running built code:
```
.\OUTPUT_NAME
```

Notes:  
- Because all data on a computer is just a sequence of bits, we use a data type (often called a “type” for short) to tell the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way
- Integral means “like an integer”. Most often, integral is used as part of the term integral type, which includes all of the Boolean, characters, and integer types (also enumerated types, which we’ll discuss in chapter 9). Integral type are named so because they are stored in memory as integers, even though their behaviors might vary (which we’ll see later in this chapter when we talk about the character types).
- In C++, strings aren’t a fundamental type (they’re a compound type)
